# Cafe-Website
A simple Flask app for finding cafés with WiFi, power sockets, and decent coffee. Built with Flask, SQLite, and Jinja templates, it lets you browse cafés in a clean card layout, add new ones, and remove existing entries. A small project focused on practicing CRUD, databases, and basic front-end styling with CSS Grid.
